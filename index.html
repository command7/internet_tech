          In 1958, the US Department of Defense(D0D) created Advanced Research Projects Agency(ARPA) which was funded to improve US military technology. One of the projects funded by ARPA was ARPANET which invented the first packet switching network and implemented TCP/IP protocols laying down the foundations of Internet. Internet can be described as a network of inter connected computers that is used as a basis for several other internet technologies such as Email, Telnet, etc., It is a decentralized network the connects several billion independent devices. These devices communicate with each other through the means of several protocols.

          <p class="gridHeadings">Web</p>
          Tim Berners Lee is considered to be the father of the Web. He invented the basic blocks of the web such as HTML, URI and HTTP. The web can be described as a way of accessing information through the internet. It uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol to transmit these hyper text documents to browsers which are software used to display these documents.

      <h2>Internet Technologies</h2>

      <div class="internetTechContainer">
        <div class="email">
          <p class="gridHeadings">Email</p>
          Email or electronic mail is the process of exchanging computer messages through the Internet. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol(SMTP) is one of the common protocols used for sending emails and POP3 is one of the commonly used protocols to receive emails. E-mail messages mostly send text which are encoded in ASCII. It can also send other non-text files such as images, videos, zip files etc through binary stream. However, E-mails support only attachments that are of the size of a few megabytes.
        </div>
        <div class="telnet">
          <p class="gridHeadings">Telnet</p>
          Telnet is a networking protocol and a software program that allows remote access to a computer through the means of the Internet. It provides access to the computer's resources as a user of that computer. It was created in 1969 and was standardized as one of the first Internet standars by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF).

        <div class="ssh">
          <p class="gridHeadings">SSH</p>
          Secure Socket Shell(SSH) is similar to Telnet and provides remote access to computers. However, it is much more secure compared to the Telnet. SSH provides strong authentication and an encrypted channel for communication thereby providing secure access to the device.
        </div>
        <div class="ftp">
          <p class="gridHeadings">FTP</p>
          File Transfer Protocol is a client-server protocol defined in 1971. It allows users to upload, download, delete, rename, move and copy files on a server. The client requests the server for a file using the FTP protocol and the server responds with the file if it is present through the same protocol.
        </div>
        <div class="http">
          <p class="gridHeadings">HTTP</p>
          Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is the protocol used by the Web and it defines how information is formatted and how web servers are supposed to respond to different requests. It is a stateless protocol where each request is treated independently without any knowledge about previous requests. It has a set of status codes that are supplied based on the request. For example, If a request is valid it supplies a 200 code and if a file that is not present in the server is requested , it sends a 404 status code etc.,
        </div>
        <div class="gopher">
          <p class="gridHeadings">Gopher</p>
          Gopher is an application layer protocol that was conceived in 1991 at University of Minnesota. It was designed to access a web server or a database through the Internet. It provides the ability to extract and view web documents that are stored in servers. Eventually, Gopher was replaced by Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP). However, a very few Gopher based databases, servers and websites are present in today's world.
        </div>
        <div class="browser">
          <p class="gridHeadings">Browser</p>
          Browsers are client applications that are used to access, display and modify information in the World Wide Web. It sends requests to web servers using HTTP protocol, receives appropriate responses from the server and displays them to users. When a client types in an URL in the address bar, it sends a request to the IP address where the content is present and retreives it for the user. The first web browser was called WorldWideWeb and was created in 1990. It was later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion.

        <div class="lynx">
          <p class="gridHeadings">Lynx</p>
          Lynx is a keyboard based web browser developed at the University of Kansas primarily for students using UNIX workstations. It does not have mouses integrated with it and hence everything would have to be controlled using the keyboard. Lynx does not support Javascript or Adobe Flash and cannot display various types of non-text content.
        </div>
        <div class="mosaic">
          <p class="gridHeadings">Mosaic</p>
          Mosaic was the first graphical browser that increased the number of users of the web by a drastic number. It came into picture by 1993 and Marc Andreessen is credited with leading the developement of Mosaic. The creators of Mosaic browser moved to a company called Netscape which was the most popular browser at that time until Microsoft's Internet Explorer was invented.
