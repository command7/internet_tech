            Tim Berners Lee is considered to be the father of the Web. He invented the basic blocks of the web such as HTML, URI and HTTP. The web can be described as a way of accessing information through the internet. It uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol to transmit these hyper text documents to browsers which are software used to display these documents.

            In 1958, the US Department of Defense(D0D) created Advanced Research Projects Agency(ARPA) which was funded to improve US military technology. One of the projects funded by ARPA was ARPANET which invented the first packet switching network and implemented TCP/IP protocols laying down the foundations of Internet. Internet can be described as a network of inter connected computers that is used as a base for several other internet technologies. Some of these technologies are
            <ul>
              <li>CLI and GUI - Different types of interfaces for the user to interact with the computer.</li>
              <li>SSH and Telnet - Protocols used to obtain remote access to systems.</li>
              <li> HTML, CSS - Programming languages used to instruct the browser about rendering content.</li>
              <li> Lynx, Mosaic - Early web browsers that servered during the origing of Internet.</li>
              <li>FTP, HTTP - Protocols used to send and receive content which may either be text, files or other types of media.</li>
            </ul>
             It is a decentralized network that connects several billion independent devices. These devices communicate with each other through means of protocols designed particularly for the Internet. Tim Berners Lee is considered to be the father of the Web. He invented the basic blocks of the web such as HTML, URI and HTTP. The Web can be described as an interconnected system of hypertextd documents that can be accessed through the Internet. It uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP) to transmit these hyper text documents to software such as browsers that are designed to render and deliver these messages to the client.
